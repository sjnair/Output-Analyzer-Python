# Output-Analyzer-Python

Python GUI built during first few weeks as QRE
Streamlines data analysis previously being done manually (by scrolling through test results in Notepad++!)
There was an obvious need for this tool, the team simply lacked the programming abilities to create it

GUI built with Tkinter (included in Python 3), so no library install needed for users
Later packaged into exe file for easier access
Then re-built with JS for users to access via internal server with no download/installs needed
